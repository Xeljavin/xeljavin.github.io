# Wait, is this a website?
Yes, you heard it right. So I finally decided to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my own website. I may not remember all the syntax, but at least I understand how the code functions, sort of. You can visit the website [here](xeljavin.github.io). Also see attributions [here](https://github.com/Xeljavin/xeljavin.github.io/blob/main/ATTRIBUTIONS.md).
